It's crazy to think about. It hasn't felt like a year at all and yet we've done so much together I have no idea how we've crammed it all in. From road trips to traveling across the state, There's been too much for it all to have taken place in just one year. I have so many good memories with you its no wonder I don't believe they can all fit into one year. All of the midnight Speedway trips (that have now turned into Holiday trips), gotta go somewhere to get our late night snacks and you're crunchy water.&nbsp;</p><figure class="figure" style="max-width: 300px;"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/anniversary_2.jpg" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure."><figcaption class="figure-caption">Insert Witty Caption Here</figcaption></figure><h4>Here's to Many More</h4><p>You've stuck with me through what five different jobs now? There is gonna be at least on more in the future, and we both know it's probably gonna more than that. You've been with me through all of the family drama and struggles. I would like to think that I am close to figuring it out, but whether or not I am, I know that you'll be there with me through it all. We've helped each other through all the ups, and all the downs and I'm sure that it will stay that way. I am not going anywhere any time soon and I will be here beside you through whatever comes our way.&nbsp;<br><br>I've spent almost every night sleeping next to you for the post year and to be completely honest I enjoy it more than anything. From when we first started dating and I lived at Gene's house, we both would sleep in that tiny little twin size bed cuddled against each other. All the nights we would come in and dust off snow and hide under that fuzzy gray blanket to stay warm. It seems like a lifetime ago but it was just a year.<br><br>Now we've both upgraded to full size beds but the way we sleep hasn't changed. Change the blankets. Change the pillows. But us? We still sleep cuddled together, a cat by our feet, still just enjoying the bliss of a simple touch. Even though it's been a year I'm glad that hasn't changed.<br></p><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><figure class="figure" style="max-width: 300px;"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/anniversary_4.jpg" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure."><figcaption class="figure-caption">One of our good moment from Milwaukee</figcaption></figure><figure class="figure" id="mobile-cheers" style="max-width: 300px;"><img class="img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/anniversary_3.jpg"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Cheers to another year</figcaption></figure></div><div class="col"><p>I could ramble on about everything that's happened over the past year for way too long.&nbsp; I've grown a lot over the past year and I think that in a lot of those ways its been for the better. You've been there to help me through those changes. Encouraged me to go to therapy, listened to me as I struggled with admitting I was sexually assaulted, and a bunch of other things too. You've never pushed,&nbsp; but you always give me a space to explore myself. I've become a lot more comfortable with myself and my own identity. It's always evolving and changing but I am embracing myself for who I am, and enjoying dressing in different ways. You gave me a space to be comfortable and explore myself and I definitely needed that to find myself.&nbsp;<br><br>I know that you're figuring your own things out too and I will always be here for you to give you that space. I'm pretty sure that one day you'll end up changing your name, but for now I just want you to do whatever you're most comfortable with. I think you're name is very pretty but I know that for you it doesn't fit well. Whatever you decide is best for yourself is what I will be on board with. I will defend your decision to anyone and embrace any name you choose, even if it's the name you already have. Names are a funny thing and there isn't any reason they need to stay the same our whole lives.<br><br>I know that we will both continue to grow and change together. Moving across the country is going to be a big change, but it seems more exciting than scary. It's a new place for us to go and explore together and I don't know I liked Portland a lot when we went. I know that the future is gonna hold a lot for us but it's nothing that we can't handle together, besides life's new challenges keep life interesting for us.&nbsp;</p><figure class="figure" id="web-cheers"><img class="img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/anniversary_3.jpg"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Cheers to another year</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div></div></section></main><footer class="page-footer dark"><div class="footer-copyright"><p>© 2020 Droo Mares</p></div></footer><script src="assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/baguettebox.js/1.10.0/baguetteBox.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/script.min.js"></script></body></html>
