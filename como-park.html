I don't have any pictures from the original walk that happened in August from sophomore year, but you look cute in this one so I used it anyways. We've gone to Como plenty of times, but none have come close to being as crazy as that first time. Staying up all night long (I don't even know if I could do an all nighter anymore) and then walking to Como when the sun came up.</p><figure class="figure" style="max-width: 300px;"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/como_spring_2.jpg" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure."><figcaption class="figure-caption">Such a cutie</figcaption></figure><h4>Never Too Many Trips</h4><p>We've gone to Como a hundred times before, but I feel that we could go a hundred more. Every time there is always a different outfit, another spontaneous photo shoot. I enjoy going for our walks, which is possibly the silver lining of this whole pandemic thing is that it's given us the chance to go for walks a lot more often.<br>

I love just walking next to you holding you're hand, or you holding my arm. The way your eyes twinkle in the sun as we walk into it. Having the light hair colors, make your eyes seem much lighter too. Almost a honey or light almondy color. All the weird things we've found while walking around. I've lost track of how many baubles you've brought back and hung up on the walls. The city is full of shiny things to collect and you seem intent on doing so.<br>

We've started crossing over all our old paths, and each time there are new memories to be made for each house, block, or crazy business. Each neighborhood has become dotted with different conversations or topics, that we'll be able to recall as we drive through them. Our walks started at Como, the pandemic widened them, and I'm sure that after all of this we'll still be going for more.&nbsp;</p></div></div><figure class="figure" style="max-width: 300px;"><img class="img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/como_spring.jpg"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Absolutely Beautiful</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></section></main><footer class="page-footer dark"><div class="footer-copyright"><p>© 2020 Droo Mares</p></div></footer><script src="assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/baguettebox.js/1.10.0/baguetteBox.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/script.min.js"></script></body></html>
