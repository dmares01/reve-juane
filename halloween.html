                        <div class="post-info"><span>By Drew Mares</span><span>May 10, 2020</span></div>
                        <p>This has to be one of my favorite costumes that I've ever done. I mean the face paint was a pain to get off, but 100% worth it. I think our costumes went over pretty well, let me rephrase that, I believe that all of our costumes
                            went over pretty well. I would like to do a better Prince Eric in the future though.</p>

                        <h4>Halloween: Part 2</h4>
                        <p>I always enjoyed Halloween bu this year it was taken to a whole different level. Not only did I have one amazing costume, but I actually got to wear three. Granted I had a lot of help with all of them, but they all came together
                            beautifully. The late night trip to Mickey's was pretty amazing. Grumpy old men, cheap food, good company, and plenty of laughs. I wouldn't have changed anything about that night. It would've been nice if the tables were open,
                            but we made the counter work just fine. Sitting next to you, sharing some fries, both having way too much coffee. It was a perfect night.</p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-6">
                                <figure class="figure"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/riverdale_shylie.jpg" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.">
                                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Lorem Ipsum dolor</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col">
                                <p>To be honest there were times I kind of forget there was two more there with us. I was just so focused on you, that I kind of forget everything else existed. Especially when we were driving back and you were sitting in
                                    the pasenger seat, everything else disappeared. It was a great evening and you definitely had all of my attention. It may sound cheesy but I couldn't keep my eyes off of you, and I don't think I will ever not be able
                                    too. It seems that no matter what you wear, or how you look, you're always drop dead gorgeous to me. It probably has to do with the fact that you're beautiful on the inside too. Beautiful beyond belief. A kind soul,
                                    a caring smile, a heartful laugh. With traits like that on the inside how could I not be in love with you?</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>It feels like a life time ago compared to today, but looking throught these pictures it all comes flooding back to me. Your smile, you coming and braiding that wig. I still can't believe you made an entire instagram for it. You
                            look beautiful in it and so I get it, but you're crazy sometimes. It doesn't matter though because I love you no matter what crazy things you do, and I will be here to support you with all of them. Even if it means getting
                            scared to death by a wig being placed on a lamp in a dark room.</p>
