Honestly he will always be a tiny thing. He will never be as big as Sherlock but that's totally alright. He is absolutely adorable if not a little bit of a demon, and I love him with my entire heart. Agreeing to raise him is by far one of the best decisions I ever made, and I have to say I think I might be leaning towards being more of a cat person now (although I still adore dogs). I remember the first night we got home and I wanted to sleep in the living room because I didn't want him to be alone. You finally talked me into sleeping in bed, but I still woke up in the middle of the night and moved to the couch anyways. He was so small, and he couldn't even produce enough body heat to keep himself warm yet. I know I was being overprotective but your sister would've killed me if I let anything happen to him.&nbsp;</p><figure class="figure" style="max-width: 300px;"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/jasper.jpg" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure."><figcaption class="figure-caption">So small and fluffy</figcaption></figure><h4>Tiny Thing</h4><p>Those first few weeks he was around had a lot of changes. He had no idea where he was, and we had to try to balance taking care of him, and adjusting Sherlock to his tiny existence as well. Once they finally got accustomed to each other and could mildly get along it made taking care of them a lot easier. Sherlock was finally allowed in the living room again, and Jasper could explore the rest of the house. Watching him try to walk around the house with one leg still up scratching himself probably could've gone viral. We used to call him tiny thing so much, he started to think it was his name. Now he knows his name he just chooses to ignore us when we say it.&nbsp;</p><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><figure class="figure" style="max-width: 300px;"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/jasper-4.jpg" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure."><figcaption class="figure-caption">Chilling like a little prince</figcaption></figure><figure class="figure" id="mobile-cheers" style="max-width: 300px;"><img class="img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/jasper-3.jpg"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Both our boys</figcaption></figure></div><div class="col"><p>He slowly figured it out though and now he proudly walks on all four legs. It's strange to think back about how small he used to be compared to now. Or the fact that he wasn't even born yet at this time last year. But I think it would be weirder to have a house without a cat. We're so used to him being around the house would feel empty without some kind of pet in it (my fish doesn't count). Once we move in together they will have to learn how to share our attention again, but they also will keep each other busy too.</p><p>When we do live together, Jasper will just have two overprotective dads, Sherlock and me. Granted I don't know if Sherlock is overprotective or not, but he definitely cleans him a lot. Also will have to figure out some litter box situation that works for both of them. I swear they're complete opposites sometimes. Either way we can figure that out once it actually happens. The more interesting part will be getting Sherlock to stay in a car for 24 hours as we drive to Portland. I'm honestly not sure if it will be easier to have them both in the same car, or to move them separately. Jasper might help him or just drive him utterly insane. A test drive with both of them in the car for an hour or two probably wouldn't be the worst idea, although Sherlock would suggest otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time Jasper needs to live with all of your plants, I will have taught him to stop knocking them over. He does good with the full grown plants, it's just the propagations that he seems to wanna play with. Who knows maybe Sherlock can teach him his wise ways so that way he will leave them alone. Also I hope you do realize that whatever house we move into is going to be a complete jungle between the two of us. I don't have a lot of plants now, but I am fully planning on getting more. And the whole giant fish tank for water plants and only one Betta is probably gonna happen too. Maybe a few snails in there just to help keep it clean but water plants are super pretty and our house has to have some in them. So two cats, plenty of plants, and a fish will probably be enough to keep us busy.&nbsp;</p><figure class="figure" id="web-cheers"><img class="img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/jasper-3.jpg"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Both our boys</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div></div></section></main><footer class="page-footer dark"><div class="footer-copyright"><p>© 2020 Droo Mares</p></div></footer><script src="assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/baguettebox.js/1.10.0/baguetteBox.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/script.min.js"></script></body></html>
